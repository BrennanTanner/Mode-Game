## Big Mo's Delivery

This is a javascript videogame that I built for a game jam. It was built in 3 weeks using Phaser 3 and a plugin for creating an isometric view.

### Overview
Play it on itch.io [here](https://ggmg.itch.io/big-mos-delivery) 

### Isometric Plugin

This was the most difficult part of the project. I used [this plugin](https://github.com/sebashwa/phaser3-plugin-isometric) by user sebashwa. The problem I ran into was that it was abandoned 5 years ago and is outdated.
I forked this repository are updated it to work with the latest version of Phaser 3. It was a lengthy process and took probably 50% of my 3-week time limit. It was so satisfying to get the plugin to work properly and begin work on my game.
